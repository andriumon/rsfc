# Research Software Fairness Checks (RSFC)

A command line interface to automatically evaluate the quality of a Github or Gitlab repository.

**Authors**: Daniel Garijo, Andrés Montero


## Features

Given a repository URL, RSFC will perform a series of checks based on a list of research software quality indicators (RSQI). The RSQIs currently covered by the package are:

- software_has_license
- software_has_citation
- has_releases
- repository_workflows
- version_control_use
- requirements_specified
- software_documentation
- persistent_and_unique_identifier
- descriptive_metadata

For more information about these RSQIs, you can check https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/indicators. We have plans to implement all of the RSQIs available in that repository.


## Requirements

Python 3.10.8 or higher

Dependencies are available in the requirements.txt file located in the root of the repository

## Install from Github

To install the package, first clone the repository in your machine

```
git clone https://github.com/oeg-upm/rsfc.git
```

Go to the project's root directory

```
cd rsfc
```

And then run in that directory

```
pip install .
```

You all can install the package with Poetry
This project uses Poetry for dependency and environment management.

Install Poetry (if you haven’t already)

```
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

Make sure Poetry is available in your PATH

```
poetry --version
```

Clone de repository

```
git clone https://github.com/juanjemdIos/oeg_rsfc.git
cd oeg_rsfc
```

Create the virtual environment and install dependencies

```
poetry install
```

Activate the virtual environment (Optional)

```
source $(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate
```

Your terminal prompt should now show something like:

```
(rsfc-py3.11) your-user@your-machine oeg_rsfc %
```

With virtual environment activated you can tried like this:

```
rsfc --help
```

Without poetry virtual environment activated you need to use the poetry run:

```
poetry run rsfc --help
```

## Usage

After installation, you can use the package by running

```
rsfc <repo_url>
```
