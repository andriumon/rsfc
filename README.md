# Research Software Fairness Checks (RSFC)

A command line interface to automatically evaluate the quality of a Github or Gitlab repository.

**Authors**: Daniel Garijo, Andr√©s Montero


## Features

Given a repository URL, RSFC will perform a series of checks based on a list of research software quality indicators (RSQI). The RSQIs currently covered by the package are:

- software_has_license
- software_has_citation
- has_releases
- repository_workflows
- version_control_use
- requirements_specified
- software_documentation
- persistent_and_unique_identifier
- descriptive_metadata

For more information about these RSQIs, you can check https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/indicators. We have plans to implement all of the RSQIs available in that repository.
